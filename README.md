Money laundering has been affecting the global economy for many years. Large sums of money are laundered every year, posing a threat to the global economy and its security. 

The purpose of this repo is to develop, describe and validate a machine learning model that detects if a customer is involved in money laundering.
We used many models **{NN,Random Forest,Logestic regression,SVM**} to finaly choose the best model with the best accuracy. 

The models were applied to a large data set related to money laundering that we imported from the link below:
